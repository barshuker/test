## General 

- handle the case when a recipe doesn't have an image
- add a category to each recipe
- example: mark 'chocolate' as ingredient if they wrote (milk chocolate,dark etc..)
- make different types of ingredients category (for recipes that require one of a group)

- save the current ingredients when exiting the app
- sort the ingredients in the first activity
- check whats going on with the shared preferences

- check the sorts

- put extra: deletes after we finish?


#### First Activity 
- Database is loaded every time we enter the activity, is there a way to avoid it? (need to read about "Activity life cycle")

#### Fourth Activity 
- Checkbox: will only show existing items AFTER clicking any checkbox, and will only mark the existing items
  that are in the current view. god help me.
  ALSO, scrolling down remove the check from the boxes
  
#### Details Activity 
- image doesn't show up

## Questions 
- Activity's data is deleted once we leave it, is it possible to preserve its information? (without having to load it all over again, e.g. SharedPreferences)

## Improvements 

#### FirstActivity 

- auto-complete:
since we don't use dynamic arrays, the possible ingredients array has a fixed size and therefore has null slots.
the adapter for the auto-complete requires array Without null slots, forcing us to copy the entire string array.

- passing to Fourth Activity:
we pass 2 arrays:
1) Possible Ingredients array
2) String array which contains the names of all the ingredients existing in the list
then, when we start Fourth activity, we have to find the index of each ingredient from the second array in the the first array.

Can we pass the information to the fourth activity more efficiently?
